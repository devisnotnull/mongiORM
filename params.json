  "body": "# What is MongiORM\r\nMongi is a simple ORM solution for MongoDB to hep overcome some of the limitations relating to Monogo within a java based envioment. Java doesnt undertand json in any useful way and as such most frameworks marshall json into POJO objects and Vice versa. \r\n\r\nAnother method is to use a JSON builder such as in vert.x, But this approcach is both tricky and ugly.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n     <groupId>com.secdata.mongi</groupId>\r\n     <artifactId>mongi-core</artifactId>\r\n     <version>18.0</version>\r\n </dependency>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n##How to use Mongi\r\n\r\nAt its core Mongi is a simple ORM that runs off annotations wrapped around a class and its enclosed parameters. Given my experience with Mongo over the last few months i have grown fond of it but at the same time there are functions of a RDMS that i miss. \r\n\r\nMongi is my solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nTo use Mongi once you have imported the maven repo you will need to start by annotating your entities with the provided annotations. These annotations will persist across all situations.\r\n\r\n**@CollectionDefinition**\r\nThis annotation is used to declare the name of the collections relating to this entity, logically one entity will generate one collection.\r\n\r\n**@UniqueIndex**\r\nThis annotations is used to mark the variables within the entity, At the moment this will only apply a unique index to the entity in question and a index is only one level deep, E.g you cannot apply and index to an array list type. If you apply a unique index to an type of iterable type then an exception will be thrown by Mongi.\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple example, This example also used Google Gson. This is a typical pattern within the new Identity service and SCAP database.\r\n\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n@CollectionDefinition(\r\n        collectionName = \"COLLECTION_NAME\"\r\n)\r\npublic class ExampleEntity {\r\n\r\n    @Since(1.0)\r\n    @Expose\r\n    @UniqueIndex(indexName = \"entity_id_unique_index\")\r\n    private String entityId;\r\n    \r\n    @Since(1.0)\r\n    @Expose\r\n    @UniqueIndex(indexName = \"entity_name_unique_index\")\r\n    private String entityName;\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Mongo and vertx\r\n\r\nCurrently you can use Mongi with Vert.x 3.0 and the offical Vert.x mongo client\r\nSimply pass in a Vert.x instance along with the mongo config that you wish to use. Please note that with mongo once you have created a Mongo instance via its officall driver all new instances will use the same configuration unless you specify a new group within the config array.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nimport com.secdata.mongi.MongiVertxTest;\r\n// You will need to use MongiVertx\r\n// Mongo is a really simple ORM that uses annotations and relfections\r\nMongi mongi = new Mongi(vertx, mongoConfig);\r\nmongi.buildOrmSolution(\"your.entity.package.path\");\r\n```\r\nAnd your done. If you passed in a valid vert.x instance and config then Mongi will automatically create all of your collections and the indexes for those collections as per your syntax sugar.\r\n\r\n###Mongo and Vert.rx  AKA Observables\r\n\r\nIm currently moving over all of the Identity service to Observables as opposed to the standard call back approach, As such Mongi is in development with this. Bu the principle will be much the same.",
